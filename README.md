# Hack-Eye-Security
Our project will help by stopping Spam emails and giving their details to government for them to take action.
We aim to built a software which when given an IP of a spam email will find out it's information and send it to the government and at the same time block it from all our client's devices.
For now, enter an IP and you will get to know it's country, region, city, zipcode, latitude, longitude and timezone.
It's still in development so the site don't work but you can run the IP tracker.py file to find use this.
We used an public API and python language to built this software.
